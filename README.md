## Overview

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human. This project focuses on developing algorithms to automatically solve image-based CAPTCHAs, which typically involve distorted text or image recognition tasks.

## Features

Image Preprocessing: Various techniques for cleaning and enhancing captcha images.

Machine Learning Models: Implementation of machine learning and deep learning models for image recognition.

CAPTCHA Solver: Algorithm to decode and solve CAPTCHAs programmatically.

Evaluation: Metrics and tools to evaluate the performance of the recognition system.
