Overview
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human. This project focuses on developing algorithms to automatically solve image-based CAPTCHAs, which typically involve distorted text or image recognition tasks.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Various techniques for cleaning and enhancing captcha images.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of machine learning or deep learning models for image recognition.
CAPTCHA Solver: Algorithm to decode and solve CAPTCHAs programmatically.
Evaluation: Metrics and tools to evaluate the performance of the recognition system.
Installation
